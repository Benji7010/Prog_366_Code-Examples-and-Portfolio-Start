# Assignments
## Fish
I implimented fish shuffle that shuffles a list of strings separated by new lines. Then it prints to console.
You know what that means.
## Tower
Got the tower game complete!
## Demo
Nothing much, but have some idea of how the stuctures work. I also added proper Stacks and queues even if I only realised later that my queue could be better.
## Fib
Fib. Good fib. Also made Stack and Queue better.
## Sort
Sorting algorithms and the sort.
## Search
Added Search algos to the sorting project! Now you can search and sort, but not a library. :P
